# Restaurant-Search-App-ReactN
A restaurant search app that lets you search for a specific dish in a city and will show you all the restaurants 
in that city that serve the dish and separate those restaurants into price ranges.

This app was created throuhg the Udemy Course, The Complete React Native + Hooks [2020 Edition]. 
I added the functionality of accessing google maps when clicking on the address of the restaurant
and being shown the restaurant in Google Maps. I also added the ability to click on the phone number
the restaurant and being able to straight away call the restaurant.
